CAR2 Crawford Bay Airport for MSFS

Created by: CaptainVTOL

CAR2 Crawford Bay Airport was an airstrip in Crawford Bay, British Columbia which no longer exists, but is an airport in FSEconomy that is part of the Crooked Charters network and has some beautiful views. This airport is a product of VTOL Construction, a division of VTOL Aviation, and was funded by Crooked Charters. 

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits I make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all I ask is to receive credit for the airport.
